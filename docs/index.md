Cardinal is an open source Cisco access point controller. Cardinal is built on Python and uses `paramiko` to handle the configuration of access points via SSH. In order to use Cardinal, your Cisco AP's must be in autonomous mode (K9W7 IOS) and have SSH enabled. 

<h2>Deprecation Notice</h2>
Starting April 9th, 2023, Cardinal development will no longer continue. If anyone wants to continue development, please feel free to fork this repo, along with the repo for scout. I'm going to merge all of the latest dependency PRs before archiving. The latest source code is essentially v3.0, with some things missing. Thank you to everyone who contributed over the years! Overall, I think I accomplished my goal of creating an open source Cisco access point controller.
